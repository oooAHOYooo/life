Don't Be Stupid :: Cupid

## Don't be Stupid Cupid

* Don't be stupid Cupid
* Your love is not your own 
* It seems like you've gotten some things muddled up
* And jupiter needs a bone
* Oh little cupid
* You're only just a bae
* all the year you wait and wait - for this special day
* but that day has come and went
* and you'll have nothing to tell the rest
