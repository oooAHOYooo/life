Gosh I am excited - it is presently 8:00AM - and I spent 
the last hour refreshing - asking Gemini the possiblitiy
and the last 6 minutes trying to get micro - the word proceessor
I am typing on via the linux - to word wrap - couldn't figure
so forgive me in advance for the improper format
I am so excited - I want to go over to ellen and make love 
today - I will organize all of my equipment to get ready for the ahoy show 
tmrw - and the tallboyz video premiere - I am going to use the BMPCC
and I haven't in a while - I want a nice system that is easy - perhaps bringing
a suitcase - configure - open and close the camera system - maybe write a poem
edit the snow rob show - release ahoy - finish the script and send it out
get merch together - clean the house - do the laundry - make love all day -
write forth another premise to another film - give up smoking - workout
These I know are unrealstic - but come from a little boy's brain
Take footy of the snow fall - and yes I have a bunch of yearns and wants
and yes I know my time is not my own - and that really drives me bonkers
because if it were up to me - i would hermit in the woods- so then - at now
8:15a - have I scratched the itch - should I go back home with the wife?
I am downloading java and android studio on the linux - I should go now and cuddle for a bit and then get back to it. 

Today - if I could only choose one of the above - it would be to get my 
camera going - and to do good work on the prep for the poetry event + 
get ahoy on the beta store on google + humanize the script + get the teaching
portfolio ready to send.
