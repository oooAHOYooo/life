## Premise 1

Two guys in the woods are alone - they choose to live out 
there dying days - but little by little a civilization emerges
as more folks like alone - and there is debate
the town grows and grows
and it is far from the kingdoms
but because of that - they are ruled
and they are ruled with peace
and any more person that comes in disturbs that peace
but then they move away - away from the
accidental town that they have created

they didn't die at first - but they stayed because they wanted
the premise
they have to learn how to live off of the land
begin to develop these experimental foods from these seeds that grow
and then 

## PREMISE 2

A guy is going blind and sees a new world through it - he sees spectors
and the spectors see him - he understands things now
and begins to write down things on how to change gravity and the like

He has a robuscistionist companion
