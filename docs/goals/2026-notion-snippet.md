# 2026 Goals — Notion Snippet

**North Star:** In 2026, I stabilize my life, quit vaping, ship Ahoy MVP, and complete pre-production for Creatures — everything else supports or waits.

**Foundation (Non-Negotiable):** Exit Barnum June 2026. Stabilize income with CPC/Bryant. Quit vaping.

**Primary Finish Goals (ONLY 2):** 
1. Ahoy MVP Release — public platform with auth, playlists, Watchlist, 10+ users
2. Creatures Pre-Production Completion — Act I locked, test shoots done, Resolve pipeline confirmed

**Rhythms (Ongoing):** 12 Ahoy Poet Shows (monthly), 12 Ahoy Music Shows (monthly), 4 platform out-and-about touchpoints (quarterly).

**Conditional / If-Then:** Buy land (if finances allow), afterschool program pilot (if CPC hall available), afterschool job (if opportunity), office fixup (if time/budget), Pal-bot 3 (if winter schedule allows).

**Writing Practice (No Pressure):** Winter film writing, Book 1 & 2 progress (not finish), maybe start Book 3.

**Release Timing:** Target Jan 2027 (realistic), stretch Sept 2026 (if conditions align), decide later in Q2.

**Paused / Not 2026:** Full film production, land development, multiple programs, office renovation, book completion.
