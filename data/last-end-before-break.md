## Subscription Cleanup Plan (Saved Copy)

This document is a **single source of truth** for what to cancel, review, and keep based on my current Rocket Money snapshot.

---

### 🔴 Cancel / Turn Off (Priority)

Cancel these outright — they are non-essential and not income-producing:

- **Adobe Creative Cloud** — $24.45 / month  
- **ExpressVPN** — $12.95 / month  
- **HBO Max** — $11.69 / month  
- **Hearst** — $0.99 (irregular)  
- **Prime Video Channels** — $5.99 (irregular)  
- **Squarespace** — $18.21 / month  

---

### 🔍 Investigate → Likely Cancel

- **Paddle.net** — $54.95 / quarter  
  - Log in and identify the software tied to this charge  
  - Cancel unless it is clearly tied to active work

- **Amazon Digital Services** — $3.18 / month  
  - Usually Kindle, apps, or video add-ons  
  - Cancel unless intentionally used

---

### ⚖️ Decide One (Not Both)

Choose **one Google plan only**:

- **Google One** — $5.34 / month  
- **Google Workspace** — $8.93 / month  

Cancel the one that is redundant.

---

### 🟡 Optional / Re-Evaluate

- **New York Times** — $4.24 / month  
  - Keep only if read weekly

---

### ✅ Keep (Intentional)

These support income, infrastructure, or long-term financial health:

- **OpenAI** — $21.27 / month  
- **GitHub** — $4.25 / month  
- **Render.com** — $14.00 / month  
- **AHOY.OOO** — $3.00 / week  
- **Vanguard Investments** — $50.00 / month (automatic investing)  
- **GEICO** — $167.01 / month  
- **Assurant** — $14.59 / month (verify coverage, likely renters/device)

---

### 💰 Expected Outcome

After cancellations:
- Save **~$90–$110 per month**
- Save **~$1,100–$1,300 per year**
- Reduce financial and mental overhead
- Keep only tools that actively support life or work

---

### 🧠 Standing Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> If it is not used **weekly** or helping me **earn or invest**, it does not stay.

_Revisit this document quarterly._
