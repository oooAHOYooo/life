## Key Scenes to Develop

### Scene 4: The Research
**INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

Sarah sits at her laptop, surrounded by printouts and maps. The screen shows various news articles about strange occurrences in the area.

**SARAH**
(reading aloud)
"Local farmer reports seeing 'shadows moving through the corn'... 'Children report hearing voices in the field'..."

She highlights another article.

**SARAH (CONT'D)**
"Three missing persons cases in the past year, all within a five-mile radius of the field."

Mike enters with coffee.

**MIKE**
Find anything?

**SARAH**
Too much. This isn't just our field. It's happening all over the county.

### Scene 8: The Revelation
**EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY**

Sarah and Mike meet with ELDERLY FARMER (70s), who has lived in the area his whole life.

**ELDERLY FARMER**
You kids don't understand what you're dealing with. That field... it's been cursed for over a hundred years.

**SARAH**
Cursed how?

**ELDERLY FARMER**
Back in the 1800s, there was a massacre. Native Americans were buried there, but not properly. Their spirits... they're still angry.

**MIKE**
You're saying ghosts?

**ELDERLY FARMER**
Not ghosts. Something else. Something that feeds on fear.

## Notes
- Need to develop the creature mythology
- Establish the rules of the supernatural elements
- Build tension through the investigation
- Create a satisfying midpoint revelation
- Set up the final act confrontation
