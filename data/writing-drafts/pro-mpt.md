pro-mpt
Your personal prompt archive, expertise tracker, and thinking partner.

Track what you ask different AI models, learn from your patterns, and build a searchable library of your thinking journey.

# Log a prompt with context
$ pro-mpt log "How do I fix this UI bug?" --model claude --app myapp --domain dev --rating 5

# Search your entire history
$ pro-mpt search "UI" --app myapp --model claude

# See your expertise grow
$ pro-mpt expertise --domain dev

# Dashboard view
$ pro-mpt stats

## Why pro-mpt?
You ask AI systems hundreds of questions. But those conversations disappear.

pro-mpt turns them into your personal knowledge archive:

- **Find solutions you've already discovered** - "I've solved this before, what was my approach?"
- **See your growth** - Watch yourself go from asking basics to teaching others
- **Understand what works** - Which models give you the best results for different problems?
- **Version your app evolution** - Track how your prompts evolved alongside your code
- **Build your portfolio** - Prove your expertise through your actual learning journey

### Works for:
- **App development** - Track prompts while building (debugging, architecture, optimization)
- **Cooking** - Save recipes and techniques you discover
- **Writing** - Keep all your creative iterations
- **Learning anything** - Document your expertise journey

## Philosophy
Pro-mpt is built with a specific "vibe" in mind: joyful, empowering, and local-first. See `vibe.md` for our full philosophy and how it shapes the tool.

## Experimental: Self-Improvement
We are building an autonomous self-improvement loop for pro-mpt. This allows the system to analyze its own codebase, suggest improvements, and even apply them (with supervision).
```bash
python pro_autoimprove.py
```

## Data Structure
Everything lives in `~/.pro-mpt/prompts.db` (local SQLite):

prompts table:
- id (unique identifier)
- query (what you asked)
- model (which AI model)
- agent (which service)
- app (which project)
- domain (category)
- version (app version)
- response (what it answered)
- timestamp (when)
- rating (how well it worked, 1-5)
- notes (your thoughts)

## Commands Reference
| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pro-mpt log <query>` | Save a prompt |
| `pro-mpt search <term>` | Find prompts |
| `pro-mpt list` | Show recent prompts |
| `pro-mpt journal` | View daily thinking journey |
| `pro-mpt expertise` | See your journey |
| `pro-mpt stats` | Dashboard |
| `pro-mpt morning` | Daily greeting |
| `pro-mpt watch` | Ambiently watch for new prompts |

## Vision
We're building the infrastructure for your thinking.

Every prompt you ask is a signal about how you think. Over time, those signals reveal:
- What you're curious about
- Where you're getting stuck
- When you're growing
- What you're really good at

pro-mpt makes that visible.

Then, when you're ready, it becomes your competitive advantage:
- Prove your expertise (to employers, clients, yourself)
- Learn faster (by remembering what worked)
- Make better decisions (because you have precedent)
- Teach others (by sharing your journey)
