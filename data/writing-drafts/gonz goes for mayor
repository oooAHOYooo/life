A Haven Time
written 11.04.25


School was off today so I decided to wake up early and journal some of the things that have been happening lately. It had been a considerable amount of time and it was time to get to it. 

Today was the mayoral race – and I was rooting for my friend Gonzalez. 

I have known of him for a couple of years and then gotten to know him intamitely for the last 3. He was a good dude – shy – but when he spoke – or lest prompted – he gave good answers. 

Today was a big day for old Gonz – as it was the election day. Gonz did a good job at making his case be known against the incumbent mayor and he was doing a good job. Gonz was up a tough race because the city genuniely liked the current mayor. 

His stances were simple – get some sort of direct democracy approval process upon the building of new buildings – he also wanted lots of government spaces to be opened to permanent marketplaces, outdoor vendors – to limit the vape shopes – to have all the abandoned buildings turned into – not condos - 

He was weak on affordable housing because he, privately would tell me, associated them with a big scam ran by the mafia. The Mafia? I’d ask – the Itlian mafia? He laughed and told  me he didn’t know further – and in time I learned that.

Regardless of that – today was the date and Gonz was upset that he wasn’t trending higher on reddit – with only 15 up likes. He didn’t have any pollsters or knowledge of how that worked – but used the power of the internet to fill in an application and was truly on the ballot. 

He was also upset that he was not represented in the debate. 

And in all – he lost – getting less than 2% of the vote – that 2% were probably the people in this house.
