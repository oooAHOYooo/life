# RETURN FIRST

If I am reading this, it means I’m coming back after a break.

## Priority Order
1. Ahoy MVP
2. Creatures — Pre-Production
3. Everything else is paused

## First Action
- Open the Ahoy repo
- Run it locally
- Fix ONE small thing
- Stop

## Rules
- No email on day one
- No new projects
- No refactors
- Momentum > brilliance



Jan is re-entry month - not a sprint. 
- Work in 60-90 blocks only
- One task per day
- Stop while it feels easy!!
- Do not "catch up" on anything - [What does this mean?]
- Progress is measured weekly - not daily


If momentum feels shaky:
- choose smaller tasks - not more tasks
- I prioritize - consistenty - over output
