# Suggested scripts for P2G4W

Scripts for **P2G4W** (Project 2 Player Game for Wife) that you can copy into your game project when you’re ready. One folder per target.

| Target | Folder | What to do |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Unreal Engine 5** | **[ue5/](ue5/)** | Copy the `.h` and `.cpp` files into your UE5 project. See **ue5/README.md** for exact paths (Public/Private), Build.cs, and editor setup. |

In the future you can add more folders here (e.g. `ue5-blueprints/` for notes, or another engine) and keep this README as the index.
