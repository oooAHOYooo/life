# Working with UE5 Scripts in Cursor

## The Answer: Use the Same Cursor Window (Life Repo)

**You don't need a separate window!** Work directly in your life repo where you already have everything open.

---

## Recommended Setup

### Option A: Single Cursor Window (Recommended)

**Open the life repo in Cursor:**
```
C:\Users\agonzalez7\life
```

**Edit files here:**
```
data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ All your files are in one place
- ✅ Git version control is already set up
- ✅ You can see the full context (GDD, other scripts, etc.)
- ✅ Easy to commit and push changes

**Workflow:**
1. Edit `data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/*.cpp` and `*.h` files
2. Save files
3. Commit: `git add data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/ && git commit -m "Updated scripts"`
4. Push: `git push`
5. On home computer: `git pull` → `node sync-to-ue.js` → Build in UE5

### Option B: Multi-Root Workspace (If You Want Both Folders)

If you want to see both the life repo AND the UE5 project in Cursor:

1. **File → Add Folder to Workspace**
2. Add: `C:\Users\agonzalez7\life`
3. **File → Add Folder to Workspace** again
4. Add: `C:\Users\agonzalez7\Documents\Unreal Projects\CoPlago`

**Then:**
- Edit in: `life/data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/` (source of truth)
- View (don't edit): `CoPlago/Source/CoPlago/` (synced files)

**Important:** Only edit files in the `life` repo! The UE5 project files are generated by the sync script.

---

## Cursor Workspace Configuration

Create `.vscode/settings.json` in your life repo to make Cursor work better with C++:

```json
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.h": "cpp",
    "*.cpp": "cpp"
  },
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/actual-scripts": false
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/node_modules": true,
    "**/Intermediate": true,
    "**/Binaries": true
  }
}
```

## Quick Reference: Where to Edit

| What | Where to Edit | Where It Goes |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| C++ Scripts | `life/data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/` | → UE5 project (via sync) |
| Game Design | `life/data/games/gdd.md` | (Reference) |
| Documentation | `life/data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/README.md` | (Reference) |

---

## The Golden Rule

**Always edit in the life repo, never in the UE5 project directly!**

Why?
- Life repo = Source of truth ✅
- UE5 project = Generated/synced files (will be overwritten) ❌

If you edit in UE5 project:
- Changes will be lost on next sync
- No version control
- Can't share with team

---

## Daily Workflow Example

**Morning (on script computer):**
```bash
# Open Cursor with life repo
cd C:\Users\agonzalez7\life
cursor .

# Edit files
# File: data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/P2G4WCharacter.cpp
# Make changes, save

# Commit
git add data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/
git commit -m "Added jump boost feature"
git push
```

**Evening (on home computer with UE5):**
```bash
# Pull latest
cd C:\Users\agonzalez7\life
git pull

# Sync to UE5
cd data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5
node sync-to-ue.js

# Open UE5, click Compile, Play!
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Use Cursor's file explorer** - Navigate to `data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/` and you'll see all your C++ files
2. **Use Cursor's search** - Search across all files with `Ctrl+Shift+F`
3. **Use Git integration** - See changes, commit, push all in Cursor
4. **Keep UE5 open** - Faster iteration (hot-reload vs full build)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I edited files in the UE5 project and they disappeared"
- You edited the wrong location! Always edit in `life/data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/`
- The UE5 files are generated - they'll be overwritten on next sync

### "How do I see what changed?"
- Use Cursor's Git panel (Source Control icon)
- Or: `git diff data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/`

### "Can I use Cursor's C++ IntelliSense?"
- Yes! Cursor will provide autocomplete and error checking
- It reads the files directly, no special setup needed

---

## Summary

**One Cursor window, one workflow:**
1. Edit in `life/data/games/suggested-scripts/ue5/`
2. Commit and push
3. On other computer: pull → sync → build → play

No need for separate windows or complex setups!
