**Dear reader - 

1. Focus on the MVP
**

---

## A. Foundation (Non-Negotiable)

These are the bedrock. Without these, nothing else holds.

#### Exit Barnum June 2026




#### Stabilize Income with CPC/Bryant

**Definition of Done:** I have consistent monthly income from CPC and Bryant work that covers baseline expenses, with clear boundaries on scope and time.

**Why it matters:** Financial stability is the foundation. This work is already in motion and needs to be maintained, not expanded.

**First 3 steps:**
- Complete CPC admin portal and media gallery (existing commitments)
- Establish clear retainer structure with Bryant by Q1
- Set monthly income floor target and track against it

### Quit Vaping

**Definition of Done:** I've stopped vaping completely and maintained that for at least 3 months by end of 2026.

**Why it matters:** Health, money, and mental clarity. This is a foundation goal because it affects everything else — energy, focus, and long-term capacity.

**First 3 steps:**
- Set a quit date in Q1 (pick a specific day, not "someday")
- Research replacement strategies (gum, patches, or cold turkey — whatever works)
- Tell someone who will hold me accountable

---

## B. Primary Finish Goals (ONLY 2)

These are the two things I will actually finish in 2026. Everything else is either ongoing rhythm or conditional.

### Ahoy MVP Release

**Definition of Done:** Ahoy platform is publicly available with core features: auth, playlists/bookmarks, working Watchlist, stable deployment. At least 10 real users are using it.

**Why it matters:** This is the only revenue-generating project I can finish solo. It's finishable because it only requires me + time. This is the primary business goal.

**First 3 steps:**
- Fix Render deploy issues and stabilize Flask app (Q1)
- Complete auth system and core playlist features (Q1-Q2)
- Ship public beta and onboard first 10 users (Q2-Q3)

### Creatures Production Completion

**Definition of Done:** Film is complete - edited - and colored by the end of 2026.

**First 3 steps:**
- Lock Act I outline by end of Q1
- Schedule and complete test shoots (stabilization/handheld walk tests) in Q2
- Confirm Resolve pipeline and create production timeline document by Q3

---

## C. Rhythms (Ongoing Output)

These are monthly/quarterly rhythms, not "finish" goals. They build momentum and audience.

### 12 Ahoy Poet Shows

**Definition of Done:** I've produced and published 12 Ahoy Poet shows (one per month) throughout 2026.

**Why it matters:** Consistent content builds audience and validates the platform. It's also practice for the rhythm of indie media production.

**First 3 steps:**
- Set up a monthly production schedule (first Thursday of each month, for example)
- Identify first 3 poets/guests for Q1
- Create a simple production checklist to reduce friction

### 12 Ahoy Music Shows

**Definition of Done:** I've produced and published 12 Ahoy Music shows (one per month) throughout 2026.

**Why it matters:** Same as poet shows — consistency, audience building, platform validation.

**First 3 steps:**
- Set up a monthly production schedule (third Tuesday of each month, for example)
- Identify first 3 musicians/guests for Q1
- Create a simple production checklist to reduce friction

### Platform Out-and-About Touchpoints

**Definition of Done:** I've done at least one "out and about" platform touchpoint per quarter (4 total) — could be pop-ups, events, partnerships, or physical presence.

**Why it matters:** Building Ahoy isn't just digital. Real-world presence creates connections and validates the platform beyond the screen.

**First 3 steps:**
- Identify 2-3 potential Q1 touchpoints (events, spaces, partnerships)
- Pick one and commit to it by end of Q1
- Document what works and what doesn't for future quarters

---

## D. Conditional / If-Then Goals

These only happen if conditions are met. No pressure, no guilt if they don't happen.

### Buy Land

**Definition of Done:** I've purchased a piece of land that can serve as a place to sleep, write, edit, and potentially live off the land.

**Why it matters:** This is a long-term vision, but it's conditional on finances and finding the right property. It's not a 2026 requirement.

**First 3 steps:**
- Continue building wealth bucket (automated savings) throughout 2026
- Scout properties when time/budget allows (no pressure)
- Understand financing options (research, not commitment)

**Condition:** Only pursue if finances allow and the right property appears. No forcing it.

### Afterschool Program Pilot (CPC Fellowship Hall)

**Definition of Done:** I've run a once-a-week afterschool program using CPC fellowship hall, with at least one 5-session cycle completed.

**Why it matters:** This could become a stable income stream and aligns with teaching goals. But it's conditional on space availability and my capacity.

**First 3 steps:**
- Confirm CPC fellowship hall availability and terms (Q1)
- If available, design a 5-session pilot program (Q2)
- Run pilot in Q3 or Q4 if conditions align

**Condition:** Only if CPC fellowship hall is available and I have capacity after Ahoy MVP and Creatures pre-prod.

### Afterschool Program Job (New Haven Area)

**Definition of Done:** I've secured a part-time afterschool program job in the New Haven area that provides stable income.

**Why it matters:** Additional income stream and teaching experience. But it's conditional on opportunities arising.

**First 3 steps:**
- Keep an eye on job postings (low effort, no active searching)
- If a good opportunity appears, apply
- Only accept if it doesn't conflict with Ahoy MVP or Creatures pre-prod timeline

**Condition:** Only if the right opportunity appears and doesn't conflict with primary goals.

### Office Fixup

**Definition of Done:** The office is functional as a place to edit, have meetings, and code — basic improvements, not a full renovation.

**Why it matters:** Having a dedicated workspace could support all other goals. But it's conditional on time and budget.

**First 3 steps:**
- Assess what's actually needed (not wants) — make a minimal list
- If time/budget allows in Q2-Q3, tackle one improvement at a time
- Prioritize functionality over aesthetics

**Condition:** Only if time and budget allow after primary goals are on track.

### Film Pal-bot 3 (Winter)

**Definition of Done:** I've filmed Pal-bot 3 during the winter months.

**Why it matters:** This is a creative project that matters, but it's lower priority than Creatures pre-prod. It's conditional on winter schedule.

**First 3 steps:**
- Check winter schedule in Q3 (after Ahoy MVP and Creatures pre-prod are on track)
- If schedule allows, plan a simple shoot
- Execute only if it doesn't derail primary goals

**Condition:** Only if winter schedule allows and primary goals are on track.

---

## E. Writing Practice (No Pressure)

These are practice, not finish goals. The pressure is off.

### Winter Film Writing

**Definition of Done:** I've written a draft of the winter film script — it doesn't need to be perfect or finished, just written.

**Why it matters:** Writing practice keeps the creative muscles strong. No pressure to produce, just to practice.

**First 3 steps:**
- Start writing when inspiration strikes (no schedule pressure)
- Aim for a rough draft by end of 2026
- Don't worry about polish or completion

### Book Writing Practice (Book 1 & 2, Maybe Start Book 3)

**Definition of Done:** I've made meaningful progress on Book 1 and Book 2, and maybe started Book 3 — but "finished" is not the goal.

**Why it matters:** Writing books is a long-term practice. The goal is progress, not completion. This removes the overwhelm of "finish 3 books."

**First 3 steps:**
- Set a weekly writing rhythm (even 30 minutes counts)
- Focus on Book 1 first, then Book 2 when ready
- Start Book 3 only if Books 1 & 2 are in a good place

## F. Release Timing (De-Risked)

**Target: January 2027**

This is the realistic target. It gives time for:
- Ahoy MVP to stabilize and gain users
- Creatures post-production to be truly complete
- Post-production and festival submission timeline to work

**Stretch: September 2026**

This is possible IF:
- Ahoy MVP ships by Q2
- Creatures post-production completes by Q2
- Everything else aligns 

**Decision: We'll decide later**

No need to lock this in now. Revisit in Q2 2026 when we have real data on:
- Ahoy MVP progress
- Creatures pre-production status
- Overall capacity and energy

The goal is to de-risk by having a realistic target (Jan 2027) and a stretch (Sept 2026), but not committing to either until we have more information.

---

## Paused / Not 2026

These are important, but they don't fit in 2026. Pausing is strategic, not failure.

- **Full film production of Creatures** — Post-production is 2026; actual distribution is 2027+
- **Full land development** — Buying land might be 2026, but developing it is later
- **Multiple afterschool programs** — One pilot is conditional; scaling is later
- **Office full renovation** — Basic fixup is conditional; full renovation is later
- **Book completion** — Writing practice is 2026; finishing books is later

**Note:** Pausing these doesn't mean they're not important. It means 2026 is about foundation and the two primary finish goals. Everything else supports or waits.

- Foundation goals (vaping, income) get daily attention, not just one day.
- Primary Finish Goals (Ahoy MVP, Creatures) get multiple days per week.
- Rhythms (shows) happen monthly, not weekly — schedule them in advance.
- Conditional goals only happen if conditions are met — don't force them.

## How to Use This Document

- **Review monthly:** Check in on Foundation goals and Primary Finish Goals
- **Quarterly check-ins:** Assess Conditional goals and adjust based on capacity
- **Weekly rhythms:** Use the Rhythms section to plan monthly content
- **No guilt:** If Conditional goals don't happen, that's fine. They're conditional for a reason.
