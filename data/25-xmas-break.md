# Christmas → January Transition Plan (Updated)

## Core Decision
My **official return to work and execution** is **Wednesday, Jan 7**.

Anything before that is still part of the **break / transition phase**, even if I’m physically back in New Haven.

---

## Guiding Rule
> **I do not “mentally return” before my official return date.**

No warm-ups that turn into work.
No “just getting ahead.”
No soft starts that quietly exhaust me.

## Jan 7 — OFFICIAL RETURN (Re-Entry Day)

This is the real Day 1.

### Rules for Jan 7
- Read `RETURN_FIRST.md`
- One work block only (60–90 minutes)

- Stop early

No catching up.
No proving anything.

## Re-Entry Definition of Success
The return is successful if:
- I feel steady, not rushed
- I stop while it feels easy
- I still have energy the next day

Momentum comes from consistency, not intensity.

## One Sentence to Hold
> **“My return begins when I say it does.”**
