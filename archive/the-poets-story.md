# The Poet's Story

*Last week Kenny Lewis stumbled into the bar drunk. I've never seen him like this – nor have I seen him in years – but he was drunk – or least I thought. He sat down next to me – white in the face – with a look that I don't remember he was capable of giving.*

*He looked at me and asked if he could trust me – aye I said. He then told me the following, something that still haunts me even now.*

He told me that for the last couple of years he has been researching the sensory perceptions of earth worms as detectors of magnetic fields. He liked using Earth worms apparently – due to their lack of eyes or ears – and reliance on the...

He told me that he discovered some gold off of the coast of East Haven as he was looking for crustaceans – and paid a guy from the British Art Gallery – to gather all of the old prospecting maps that were registered in the New Haven county area since the founding of it. He found an old prospect mining chart – that had an unknown water body going from East Haven – all the way to the new construction on the New Haven canal.

Last week – a friend of mine surprised me as I was enjoying an evening off with a cold happy hour Playwright Pilsner. He was half hammered and was deliberate on maintaining my attention. He had news and he had to tell me now – Okay – said I – go on.

Again, it was all about Kenny Lewis – my friend's new obsession with the new man in town. Now, Kenny Lewis was a new friend – to my friend – but not to me – I knew Kenny Lewis – and I used to know him well, but my friend didn't know this – and continued to gawk at the character of this man with every chance he got – that of which – I partially enjoyed – for I wasn't going to reach out to Kenny Lewis.

He told me that two weeks prior, Kenny Lewis discovered some gold off the coast of East Haven - and paid a guy from the British Art Gallery to help him draw upon an old map that pinned the source of the gold's location – as being, surprisingly - underneath the new construction of the New Haven Canal. The mayor knew this – but didn't believe apparently.

Kenny Lewis believed that the current canal sits over what was once a tidal inlet or warehouse. He believed that New Haven's coast sits on an ancient glacial and metamorphic bedrock – which still to this day produces gold from an old hydrothermal vein system running inland beneath the canal.

He believes all of that? Asked I – Yes, said my friend – but that's not the point. Okay then, said I – get to the point.

He went on to tell me that Kenny drilled a hole no wider than his thumb through the loose backfill dirt at the edge of the canal fence. His plan was to feed a coiled cable into a shaft – which would continue to drill – and send a machine that would pulse the earth with low-frequency electromagnetic waves – listening for the distinct metallic echo of the plunder.

My friend stared at me for a while – and I stared back at him.

Apparently as he was approaching he felt the overwhelming sensation that something was watching him. He stopped digging for a bit – and he was worried that he would be caught – so he packed up his tools and went home.

Just then – the man himself stumbled into the bar – Kenny Lewis in the flesh, I hadn't seen him for a couple of years but he still looked like that...

When he was getting past the tunnel – he again – heard a distant rattling – and packing up his tools, looked up behind him – but nothing – he was worried that he would be caught by the New Haven police – and looked around - but nothing - so he continued to dig. As the hours progressed - he made a good amount of progress - but as he was digging - again, he felt the sensation that he was being watched. Taking out his camera to check the time, apparently found himself in a gap of time - that of which he was unfamiliar how he got there or what he was doing.

I didn't know what to make of this all - I went home that night and thought about something he said. Something that upset me was the way he described the way the creature's indifference to his rock throwing - that it didn't go through the skin - but stayed... He believed...
